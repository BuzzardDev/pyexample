<H1>Python Cheat Sheet Example</H1
  
<p>I wrote this to try and help people understand Python a little easier, and overall just a good python basics reference guide for simple projects.
  I plan to add more at some point just depends when I want to, my hands hurt lol.</p>
  
 <H2>Printing</H2>
 
 <p>Ok so printing in python is a basic concept essentially what it means is the text inside the double quotes inside the print function will
be typed out as text in the console/terminal</p>

<code>print("Hello, World")</code>

 <H2>Operators</H2>
 
 <p>Python operators are very similar to math, I cover them in the file however here I will just name them add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, round, powers</p>
 
 <code>1+1</code>
 <code>1-1</code>
 <code>1*2</code>
 <code>1/2</code>
 <code>2%1</code>
 <code>round(2.4415)</code>
 <code>2**2</code>


 <H2>Variables</H2>
 
 <p>Think of a variable like an ID that ID needs a value, so you assign 435 to ID named class number. Variables allow you to store data text, numbers whatever. Most variables in python should also use Camel Casing to making reading easier. (camelCase)</p>
 
  <code>studentID = 628266</code>
  
 <H2>Loops</H2>
 
 <p>The python file explains this more in depth than I will here but a loop is a chunk of code being ran over and over. Like a if/else may not think thats a loop but it is. A loop is just repeating</p>
 
 <code>while code == "python":</code>
 
 <code>  print("Love to see it")
